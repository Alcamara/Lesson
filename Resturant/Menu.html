			<h4>Spinach Noddles (B&#333 C&#225;i Mi&#225;n)</h4>
			<p>This traditional Chinese food dish includes noodles made from spinach, then topped with whatever ingredients your heart desires. The above serving has a spicy tomato-like sauce and is topped with egg, potato, carrots, beef and chili.</p>
			
			<h4>Fried Mashi (ch&#259;o m&#225; shi)</h4>
			<p> This gnocchi-lookalike, though, is quite different. It's a little bit sweet, but it's hot and hearty. The additional crunchy vegetables provide a delicious juxtaposition next to the soft thickness of the m&#225; shi.</p>
			
			<h4>BBQ Meat (k&#259; r&#242;u)</h4>
			<p> k&#259; r&#242;u is the standard serving of meat in China and might be one of the most well known traditional Chinese foods available.They are heavily spiced and you can order either  lamb, beef, chicken, or gizzards.</p>
			
			<h4>Cold Vegetable Dish (li&#225;ng c&#224;i)</h4>
			<p>li&#225;ng c&#224;i, which literally translates to “cold dish,” is an assortment of vegetables, tofu and peanuts, served with a marinade or sauce. The usual suspects are green beans, cucumbers, lotus root and cabbage, </p>
			
			<h4>Dumplings (ji&#259;o &#576;i)</h4>
			<p> ji&#259;o &#576;i can be  filled with beef, pork or veggies.</p>
			
			<h4>Sweet and Sour Eggplant (y&#250; x&#299;ang qu&#233; &#576;i)</h4>
			<p>This is a bowl of sliced eggplant that tastes more like sweet and sour pork than a vegetable. A little bit of chili and fish sauce.</p>
